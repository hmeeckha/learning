## How to sync to Github

Your local files will not be synced automatically with the Github repo! You have to do this yourself.

Git actions:
* pull: pull changes from remote repo (if you are in collaboration with others)
* add: stage files for commit; click on stage box under git pane
* commit: commit to the local repo; click on "commit" button under git pane; add a commit message
* push: push to the remote repo on Github


1. Before we start working on collaborative projects, usually the first thing we do is pull in the changes from the remote repo, in our case, the one to GitHub.

2. Add file

3. Commit file

4. Push changes to repo

## Status symbols

In the git pane, the files have a symbol.
* Yellow square: Git knows nothing about this file.
